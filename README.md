The Homestead Hub – Bootstrap Responsive Website
The goal of this project was to build a fully responsive website using the Bootstrap framework while following proper semantic HTML structure and best practices.

Project Overview
Building a clean, responsive layout using Bootstrap
Using only the framework’s built-in classes (no custom CSS or JavaScript)
Structuring the HTML semantically to create a logical document outline
Ensuring the website validates without HTML errors
Optimizing images and naming them appropriately
Running a Lighthouse audit and improving performance where possible
The typography and colour system used in this project come directly from Bootstrap’s default styles.

Key Features
Sticky Header
The header remains fixed at the top of the screen while scrolling.

Responsive Navigation Bar
The navigation collapses on smaller screens and expands at the large breakpoint.
It uses Bootstrap’s toggle functionality and JavaScript library.

Carousel Component
Implemented using Bootstrap’s JavaScript components.

Semantic HTML Structure
The document is structured using appropriate sectioning elements to ensure a clear and logical outline.

Optimized Images
All images are semantically named and properly sized for performance.

Lighthouse Auditing
I ran Lighthouse to identify missing meta tags and improve overall accessibility and SEO.
Due to Bootstrap’s file sizes, achieving a perfect score is not realistic, which is expected.

Technologies Used
HTML5
Bootstrap (CSS & JavaScript)
Lighthouse (for auditing and optimization)
